# React Router 3‑Page Template

A minimal React + Vite template with **three pages** using **react-router-dom v6**.

## Pages
- `/` — Home (with links to the other two pages)
- `/about` — About
- `/contact` — Contact

## Scripts
```bash
npm install
npm run dev       # start dev server
npm run build     # production build
npm run preview   # preview the production build
```

## Notes
- Router uses `BrowserRouter` with standard paths.
- Styles are minimal; adjust to taste.
